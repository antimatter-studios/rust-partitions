//! One check gates a pull request, and it stands for every job (#124).
//!
//! Branch protection names checks, and a check is a job name. This
//! repository used to name six of them -- `fmt`, `test (release)`,
//! `oracle (external tools)` and the three `test / <os>` matrix legs --
//! which meant the list had to be edited whenever a job was renamed, a
//! runner added to the matrix, or a job split in two. Until someone did,
//! the new work was required by nobody. The opposite spelling is worse: a
//! required check no job produces reads as permanently pending, and with
//! `enforce_admins` on nothing merges and there is no failure to point at.
//!
//! So protection names one job, `ci-ok`, which `needs:` every other job in
//! `ci.yml` and fails unless each concluded success. This is what keeps
//! that true: every job in `ci.yml` has to be in its `needs`, and
//! `.github-guard` has to require it and nothing else.
//!
//! Only `ci.yml` is scanned, because only `ci.yml` runs on `pull_request`.
//! `release.yml` triggers on a `v*.*.*` tag, after the merge it would be
//! gating has already happened, and `fuzz.yml` is `workflow_dispatch` plus a
//! nightly cron. Neither reports on a pull request, so requiring anything
//! from either would be a check that never reports -- which GitHub reads as
//! permanently pending, and with `enforce_admins` on nothing merges.
