//! The header names the library the build actually produces.
//!
//! `include/partitions.h` said "Link with libam_partitions.a" for as long as the file
//! existed, and cargo has never produced that name: `[lib] name` is
//! `partitions`, so the artefact is `libpartitions.a` — which is exactly what
//! `chores.yml` copies. A C consumer following the header got a linker
//! error for a library nobody builds.
//!
//! **The expected name is DERIVED from `Cargo.toml`, not written down
//! here**, so renaming the library fails this test rather than silently
//! making the header wrong again.
//!
//! # Why `toml` and not a hand parse
//!
//! The first version of this file hand-parsed `Cargo.toml` by scanning
//! lines, and rejected three spellings cargo accepts: `name = 'partitions'`
//! in single quotes, `name = "partitions" # comment` with a trailing
//! comment, and `[lib] # comment` — the last making the test claim the
//! manifest declares no library at all. A guard that a legal edit to the file it
//! guards can break is one somebody deletes rather than fixes.
//!
//! A guard asserting something about a structured file must PARSE it.
//! `toml` is a dev-dependency only, so nothing reaches a consumer.
//!
//! The C header is the exception, and deliberately: there is no parser
//! for it here, so `libraries_named` scans. That is a stated limit
//! rather than a quiet one.
