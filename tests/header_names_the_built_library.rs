//! The header names the library the build actually produces.
//!
//! `include/partitions.h` said "Link with libam_partitions.a" for as
//! long as the file existed, and cargo has never produced that name:
//! `[lib] name` is `partitions`, so the artefact is `libpartitions.a` —
//! which is exactly what `chores.yml` copies. A C consumer following
//! the header got a linker error for a library nobody builds.
//!
//! Six of the twelve constellation repositories had the same mismatch
//! while five had it right and one named no library at all, so it is
//! not a naming rule anybody applies once — it drifts, and therefore
//! wants a check.
//!
//! **The expected name is DERIVED, not written down here.** It comes
//! from `Cargo.toml`'s `[lib] name`, which is what decides the artefact
//! name, so renaming the library fails this test instead of silently
//! making the header wrong again.
