# Working in rust-partitions (agent guide)

Pure-Rust partition-table probe, filesystem-magic sniffer and table writer over
any random-access block source, exposing a C ABI, validated against `sgdisk`,
`sfdisk`, `blkid` and `partx` as the oracle. This file is the fast path for an
agent picking up work here, so the workflow does not have to be re-derived each
time. It points at the existing docs rather than duplicating them:

- **README** → `## What it does`, `## Status` (the read side, the write side,
  and what is deliberately not done yet), `## Layout`.
- **`tests/oracle_tools.rs`** → the module docs argue the oracle's design:
  both directions, no loop device, no root, and why a missing tool panics.
- **`.github-guard`** → why one required check and not six, argued at length.

The section between the BEGIN/END markers below is **shared, byte-identical,
with every repository in this family**. Do not edit it here: change the
canonical copy and propagate it, or `chore lint` will fail. Everything after
the END marker is specific to this repository.

## Claiming work

Several agents work these repositories at the same time. Before you start on
an issue, claim it, so nobody else spends a session on what you are already
doing. The lock is a **GitHub label**, because labels are shared state that
every agent can read and change without posting comments into the thread.

**Before starting.** Check, claim, then read back:

```sh
gh issue view <N> --json labels                      # holds `claimed`? pick another
gh issue edit <N> --add-label claimed --add-label claim/<session>
gh issue view <N> --json labels                      # read back and confirm
```

`<session>` is your session name — `agent-<random4>-<isodate>`, e.g.
`agent-3f7c-2026-09-22`. Create the `claim/<session>` label if it does not
exist.

**Resolving a race.** Adding a label is not compare-and-swap: two agents can
both add `claimed` and both believe they won. That is what the read-back is
for. If it shows more than one `claim/*` label, the **lexically lowest**
session keeps the issue; every other agent removes its own `claim/*` label and
picks different work. Each racer computes the same answer independently, so no
further coordination is needed.

**When you finish or stop.** Remove both labels — on merge, or the moment you
abandon the work:

```sh
gh issue edit <N> --remove-label claimed --remove-label claim/<session>
```

Delete your `claim/<session>` label from the repository at the end of your
session so they do not accumulate.

**Reclaiming a stale claim.** An agent that dies holding a claim would block an
issue forever. If `claimed` was applied more than 12 hours ago and the holder's
branch has no commits since, any agent may take it: remove the stale `claim/*`,
add your own, and say so in the issue.

**This is a convention, not a fence.** Nothing enforces it. An agent that
ignores it duplicates work; it cannot corrupt anything. Honour it anyway.

## Skills to use

- **`dev-loop`** — the required loop for any non-trivial change: baseline the
  full suite → change → re-run (no baseline test may regress) → enhance tests →
  vet. Always run it.
- **`commit`** / **`pr`** — for grouping commits and opening pull requests.

Each repository names any further skills of its own below.

## A bug fix starts with a red

**Prove it is broken first** — a failing check or test — *then* fix it, *then*
prove that same check is green, *then* confirm the full baseline still passes.
Never write the fix before you have a red. A fix with no failing test to its
name is a claim, not a result.

## Nothing skips

A test that cannot run **fails**, naming the task that would provide what it
needed. Never add an early return for a missing fixture, tool or VM: a skipped
test reads exactly like a passing one, and a suite that quietly declines to run
is indistinguishable from a suite that passes.

Where a tier reports skips or ignored tests, that is a gate, not a note.

## Validate against something that is not us

A driver's own readers share its interpretation of the format, so they cannot
catch a misreading: the mistake is baked into the fixture *and* the parser, and
they agree with each other while disagreeing with every real filesystem. Unit
tests over self-built fixtures prove self-consistency, not correctness.

Every structure that is parsed or written gets a cross-validation test against
an **independent oracle** — the platform's own tools, a real kernel, or a third
implementation — before it is considered done. Each repository names its
oracles below.

## Output is budgeted

Test tiers run through `scripts/tier.sh`, which runs the suite **quietly**: the
whole run goes to `tmp/logs/<tier>.log`, a pass prints one verdict line naming
that log, and a failure prints its tail. CI keeps the logs as an artifact, so
the detail is always retrievable.

The budget caps the log, not merely what is shown, and every number in the
table was measured. A run that passes but prints more than its budget **fails**.

The reader who pays most for a noisy suite is an agent that re-reads its whole
transcript on every step, and so pays for one loud run many times over. If a
tier legitimately grows, raise its row **with the measurement that justifies
it**. Do not silence output to fit, and do not route around `tier.sh`.

## Commits and branches

- Branches are `<type>/<name>`, matching the commit type: `fix/`, `feat/`,
  `ci/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `test/`.
- A commit is a subject plus flat one-sentence bullets. Subjects are
  declarative, not imperative: "the run-end bound is checked", not "check the
  run-end bound".
- **No AI attribution and no co-author trailers**, in commits or in pull
  request descriptions.
- `main` takes **squash merges only**.

## Project rules

- **No GPL/LGPL/AGPL dependencies.** Permissive only (MIT/BSD/Apache).
  Shelling out to a copyleft CLI as a *test oracle* is fine — linking or
  copying it is not.
- **Each of these is a standalone project.** Never mention a consuming
  application in the README, the source, or CLI help.

## What this is

Partition-table parsing — MBR and GPT — over `am-fs-core`'s device traits,
exposed through a C ABI (`tests/c_abi.rs`) and linked into the app as a
staticlib.

## Running tests

```sh
chore test        # the suite
chore build
chore lint        # fmt, the agent-core check, clippy
chore staticlib   # what the app links
```

CI runs `test`, `test-release`, `oracle`, `fmt`, and `ci-ok` aggregates them.

Both profiles are run on purpose: arithmetic that panics in debug can wrap
silently in release. `tests/ci_profile.rs` holds the debug run to being a debug
run.

## The oracle is sgdisk and sfdisk

`oracle (external tools)` builds tables with **`sgdisk`, `sfdisk`, `blkid` and `partx`** and reads
them back through this crate. That is the cross-validation the shared block
requires: our own writer and our own reader share an interpretation, so only a
third implementation can catch a misreading. A table this crate produced must
also be one those tools accept.

If a tool is missing, the job **fails** — it does not skip. Install it.

## Three workflows, one gate

`ci.yml`, `release.yml` (tag-driven) and `fuzz.yml` (nightly cron plus
dispatch). **Only `ci.yml` runs on `pull_request`**, so only its jobs may gate:
a required check that never reports is a permanent block rather than a gate.

One required check, `ci-ok`, declared in `.github-guard`. Judging mergeability
from check **conclusions** is unreliable: an in-progress `CheckRun` reports its
conclusion as an empty string, and a `StatusContext` has no conclusion field at
all. Read `mergeStateStatus` and `statusCheckRollup.state`.

`chore check:ci-gate` holds both halves of that mechanically — every job in
`ci.yml` must appear in `ci-ok`'s `needs:`, and `.github-guard` must require
`ci-ok` and nothing else. The task names `scripts/ci-gate.sh` and nothing else,
so the script is what can be tested, reviewed and run without `chore` at all.
It replaced `tests/ci_aggregate_gate.rs`: that parsed a YAML file and compared
strings, exercising nothing this crate ships, and as a `cargo test` it counted
towards the executed-test floor the gate itself enforces.

## Never grow a shared tool to solve a problem here

**Never grow a shared tool to solve a problem in this repository.** `chore` is
a general-purpose task runner this project merely consumes; the same goes for
`github-guard` and the agent-skills hooks. If something needed here looks like
it belongs inside one of them, it does not. Solve it here, or ask first. The
tell is a release: if a shared tool needs a new version cut whose only purpose
is to unblock this project, the code is in the wrong repository.
